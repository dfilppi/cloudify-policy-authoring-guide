## Scope
The purpose of this guide is to provide a practical introduction to successfully authoring Cloudify policies for use in adding dynamic, metric driven, behavior to Cloudify blueprints/deployments using native features provided by the Cloudify manager.  It is not an exhaustive guide to the underlying technologies, for which external references are supplied.

## Prerequisites
Automated post-deployment dynamism in Cloudify is provided by a combination of [TOSCA](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.0/csprd01/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.0-csprd01.html) inspired configuration (groups and policies), the metrics gathering apparatus (i.e. [Diamond](https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Diamond/wiki) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), and the [Riemann](http://riemann.io/) real time event processing engine.  For most prospective authors, understanding of Riemann's implementation and configuration language, Clojure, along with some functional programming concepts will be the most demanding task.  Fortunately, nothing like a true mastery of Clojure is required to be productive, but writing policies is an exercise (at a minimum) in coding the Riemann API, which is incomprehensible without some Clojure background.  Some resources:
- IDE - some recommend Emacs for Clojure, but Emacs can be an obstacle for those used to conventional key bindings and development environments.  Our needs are simple.  I've found that [clooj](https://github.com/arthuredelstein/clooj) is handy for trying stuff out and learning Clojure in general.
- Introduction to the language.  A video by the creator of Clojure that gives a nice beginners [overview]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P76Vbsk_3J0).
- A short intro targetted at prospective Riemann users: http://riemann.io/clojure.html.
- Handy reference.  Like any language, if you don't use it often you forget.  I find this [cheatsheet](http://clojure.org/api/cheatsheet) to be a handy reference.
- Books.  There are several and all are overkill for what you'll need.  [Clojure for the Brave](http://www.braveclojure.com/) is a good one if you want to dig deep.

Once you feel you grasp the basic syntax, even if you have to cheat to a resource frequently, you can approach Riemann.  Riemann defines event processing "streams" as high order (functions that return functions) Clojure functions.  Clojure serves both as the configuration language and the execution language.  Some resources to look over for Riemann:

- A [video](https://vimeo.com/77673896) introduction to concepts.
- The [quickstart](http://riemann.io/quickstart.html).  Follow the instructions here __explicitly__, including running the examples.
- A conceptual [overview](http://riemann.io/concepts.html)
- Explore the [API](http://riemann.io/api.html).  For now you can ignore everything except the _riemann.streams_ namespace.

Also review the relevant documentation on configuring Cloudify policies in the Cloudify [wiki](http://docs.getcloudify.org/3.3.1/manager_policies/creating-policies/).

Lastly, a very superficial understanding of Ruby is needed to understand the test drivers, which in this guide will be based on the Ruby client described in the Riemann "Quick Start" guide.  Feel free to use a different [client](http://riemann.io/clients.html) however.

## How Riemann Fits in Cloudify
When Cloudify creates a deployment, one of the tasks is to start a distinct Riemann core for that deployment.  This serves as an impenetrable barrier between event flows in different deployments.  Any policies associated with the blueprint/deployment are put in the Riemann configuration file, wrapped in some boilerplate Clojure [code](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-manager/blob/3.3.1-build/plugins/riemann-controller/riemann_controller/resources/manager.config) that among other things, connects the Riemann core to the RabbitMQ topic collectors write to, filter for the specific deployment id, and define a Clojure function that executes the workflows associated with the relevant policy.  Inside your event processing code, you don't have to worry about updating the Riemann index, calling the Cloudify REST API, or other such concerns.  Your concern is to evaluate metrics as they arrive and call the "process-policy-triggers" stream when the purpose of the policy is satisfied (i.e. "scale up when the average CPU utilization was greater than 80% over the last 5 minutes").  This will cause the workflow(s) related to the policy to run with the parameters defined in the blueprint.

## Basic Concepts For Developing Policies with Riemann

- __You must simulate your event flow accurately.__  Without simulating the event contents, distribution, timing, and possibly even rates (although rarer), there is little hope of success.
- __Riemann streams are high order functions.__ The streams you write or compose are called once at configuration time to construct a graph of functions, which are then passed each event as it arrives.
- __Riemann uses event timestamps.__  Be careful to have clocks synchronized on participating systems or confusion will reign.
- __Riemann only saves the last sample.__ Riemann only saves, via the index, the last instance of each event for each unique host/service combination.  Any other state, other than external to Riemann, will need to be saved in closed function variables.

## A Simple Policy Authoring Environment

A important principle behind developing policies is to stay as simple as possible as long as possible.  This means avoiding the Cloudify manager itself as long as possible.  A simple environment with a quick code/test/debug cycle is available with the following components:
- __The Riemann runtime__.  As instructed to in the _prerequisites_, download and install Riemann.
- __A Ruby Interpreter__.  We'll just expand on the simple example for generating events described in the __prerequisites__.  This requires Ruby available to your command line.
- __A Clojure IDE/REPL__.  As a beginner, this is essential.  The more experience you get, the less critical it is.  There are several [options](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/IDEs+and+Editors).  Again, this is for testing out Clojure syntax, not for testing of your Riemann streams.  Include the `riemann.jar` file, in Riemann's _lib_ directory, in your IDE classpath if you want it to understand Riemann APIs.

# Exercise 1: A Uselessly Simple Policy
To get your feet wet, let's build a very simple policy with no (likely) real world application.  In this policy, we'll trigger our policy triggers when a metric crosses a threshold.  We'll work directly in the environment you created in the _prerequisites_ section.  In the Riemann `etc` directory lurks the `riemann.config` file, which is the default configuration for Riemann and where we'll be trying stuff out.  Making a backup of this file is prudent in case you need to start over.  Lets look at the bottom of the file:

```clojure
(let [index (index)]
  ; Inbound events will be passed to these streams:
  (streams
    (default :ttl 60
      ; Index all events immediately.
      index

      ; Log expired events.
      (expired
        (fn [event] (info "expired" event))))))
```
The `let` statement at the top defines a new `index` (by default a hash map), that holds the last sample of each event by `host/service` pair.  Recall that `host` and `service` are fundamental keys in the Riemann data model.  Rather than take `host` too literally, think of it more like _where the event came from_.  Likewise, think of `service` as _what the metric is measuring_.  Ultimately they are just arbitrary strings.  Next is the `streams` function call.  This is what Riemann looks for to pass events to.  In the default config, the _default_ stream is just setting the default time to live for any events that arrive without `ttl` fields, and then forwarding to it's children (in this case `index` and `expired`).  Note that all streams are implicitly passed the event under consideration.  Also recall that Riemann is single threaded and processes each event to completion before consuming another.  The `index` stream (from the Riemann API) puts the event in the index, and the `expired` stream only passes through expired events to its child streams.  In this case a custom stream has been created in-line that will simply log events it receives using the Riemann `info` function.  More on custom streams later.  For now, we'll use `info` quite a bit, so we'll be copying the above definition around frequently to see what's happening in our streams (although the more concise Clojure equivalent will be used:
```clojure
#(info "message" %)
```
As a first step, lets create a stream that prints out all events that arrive.  There can be multiple `streams` function in the config file, so lets add another with our `info` log statement:
```clojure
(let [index (index)]
  ; Inbound events will be passed to these streams:
  (streams
    (default :ttl 60
      ; Index all events immediately.
      index

      ; Log expired events.
      (expired
        (fn [event] (info "expired" event)))))

  (streams
     (info "HELLO WORLD" )
  )
)
```
Assuming you're in Riemann's _etc_ directory, run `../bin/riemann`.  You'll see output like this:
```
INFO [2016-03-02 22:26:43,798] main - riemann.bin - PID 1885
INFO [2016-03-02 22:26:43,854] main - riemann.config - HELLO WORLD
INFO [2016-03-02 22:26:43,964] clojure-agent-send-off-pool-3 - riemann.transport.tcp - TCP server 127.0.0.1 5555 online
INFO [2016-03-02 22:26:43,989] clojure-agent-send-off-pool-0 - riemann.transport.udp - UDP server 127.0.0.1 5555 16384 -1 online

INFO [2016-03-02 22:26:43,992] main - riemann.core - Hyperspace core online
```
There's a problem here.  Look at the second line in the listing.  Note that `HELLO WORLD` has been printed even though we know no event has been sent!  This illustrates something you always need to remain aware of with Riemann, and that's the difference between _streams_ and regular Clojure functions.  What we're witnessing here is Riemann's "config" step, which executes the _streams_ in order to build a function hierarchy.  Riemann is executing each _stream_, and each child of each _stream_, recursively to build a tree of functions.  Once that tree is built, every event Riemann receives is fed to it.  So you see the function we defined getting called at config time (which is useless), but worse that that, the _info_ function returns `nil`, which gets stored in the function tree.  The first time a real event comes in we'll see a message like this:
```
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at riemann.core$stream_BANG_$fn__5727.invoke(core.clj:19)
        at riemann.core$stream_BANG_.invoke(core.clj:18)
        at riemann.core$instrumentation_service$measure__5736.invoke(core.clj:57)

        at clojure.lang.AFn.run(AFn.java:22)
        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)

```
The NPE is raised in this case because a regular function is a child of the `streams` function, which unfortunately isn't smart enough to check if it's a high order function.  You _can_ use regular functions but mainly in your own streams.  Otherwise make sure to wrap functions that a children of stream in a function, like so:
```clojure
  (streams
     #(info "HELLO WORLD" %)
  )
```
which produces much more useful output:
```
INFO [2016-03-02 22:31:37,550] Thread-7 - riemann.config - HELLO WORLD #riemann.codec.Event{:host vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64, :service riemann streams rate, :state nil, :description nil, :metric 0.0, :tags [riemann], :time 728478948721/500, :ttl 20}
```
Back to the business at hand.  Since policy writing boils down to identifying critical conditions in the event stream and then running the Cloudify supplied stream `process-policy-triggers`, we can simply substitute an _INFO_ stream with a recognizable message for `process-policy-triggers`, hit the streams with traffic we feel should cause the desired condition to be breached, and observe the results.  Only once the stream has been stressed to our satisfaction do we even consider integrating it into a Cloudify blueprint.

In this case we're going to test a metric for the breach of a threshold.  Perusing the Riemann API [page](http://riemann.io/api.html), under the _streams_ namespace, we find a stream called _over_.  This simple stream is just a filter that only sends events to its children whose metric exceeds the desired value.  For now we'll just use a simple hardcoded '10'.  Our `streams` function looks like this now:
```clojure
  (streams
    (over 10
     #(info "TRIGGER"  %)
    )
  )
```
Note I've changed the "HELLO WORLD" to "TRIGGER".  Once the policy is debugged, we'll replace the `info` stream with the `process-policy-triggers` stream.  If I send an event with a metric bigger than 10, I need to see that message.  If not, I better not see it.  That's brings us to the event driver.  Take the Ruby event driver code from the _prerequisites_ section, but we'll modify it a bit and put it in a file called "send.rb" also in the `etc` directory.
```ruby
r = Riemann::Client.new
r << { 
host: "www1", 
service: "http req", 
metric: 2.53, 
state: "normal" 
}
```
Start Riemann, preferable in a terminal session of it's own, and run the following command:
```ruby
irb -r riemann/client send.rb
```
This will send our event to Riemann.  We expect to see nothing, but if you wait long enough, a bunch of output appears, looking something like:
```
INFO [2016-03-02 23:58:39,495] Thread-7 - riemann.config - TRIGGER #riemann.codec.Event{:host vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64, :service riemann index size, :state ok, :description nil, :metric 34, :tags nil, :time 1456963119493/1000, :ttl 20}

```
These events are from Riemann itself, and we've put no filter to hide them.  Let's modify and simplify the config to select only events from the service we're testing.  _Note that this is unnecessary in production policies, since the Cloudify boilerplate that wraps your code does it for you_.  Now we have this:
```
; -*- mode: clojure; -*-
; vim: filetype=clojure

(logging/init {:file "riemann.log"})

; Listen on the local interface over TCP (5555), UDP (5555), and websockets
; (5556)
(let [host "127.0.0.1"]
  (tcp-server {:host host})
  (udp-server {:host host})
  (ws-server  {:host host}))

; Expire old events from the index every 5 seconds.
(periodically-expire 5)

(let [index (index)]
  (streams

    index

    (over 10
     #(info "TRIGGER"  %)
    )
  )
)
```
Now let's repeat our test.  You should see nothing.  Now change the metric value in your `send.rb` to something over 10 and try again.  Now you should get something like:
```
INFO [2016-03-03 00:15:32,761] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - TRIGGER #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 12.53, :tags nil, :time 1456964132, :ttl nil}
```
Now if we remove the event service filter and replace the info stream, we have something that can be put into a Cloudify policy type:
```clojure
(let [index (index)]
  (streams
    index
    (over 10
      (process-policy-triggers)
    )
  )
)
```
Inside a blueprint, we can take just the part of the logic that is specific to the policy, namely the `over` stream and child.  If we put that:
```clojure
    (over 10
      (process-policy-triggers)
    )
```
in an arbitrarily named file in the blueprint directory (say "policy.clj") we can define a policy type to use it that might look like this:
```yaml
policy_types:
  scale_policy_type:
    source: policy.clj
```
Note we've just defined a policy _type_, not an actual policy.  While we're in the policy type definition, lets consider how bad it is to have threshold-based policy like this with a hard coded ceiling.  I'd rather be able to define the ceiling in the blueprint.  Cloudify has a syntax for defining policy properties that get fed to the underlying policy code.  Let's define a property for our threshold:
```yaml
policy_types:
  my_policy_type:
    source: policy.clj
    properties:
      threshold:
        description: the threshold
        default: 10
```
By defining this in the policy type, I tell Cloudify to examine the policy.clj file and do a basic template substitution looking for the string "{{threshold}}" (or more generally "{{property-name}}).  So to exploit our new property we make an edit to the `policy.clj` file:
```clojure
    (over {{threshold}}
      (process-policy-triggers)
    )

```
To use the policy type, we have to instantiate it, and this is done in a `group` definition in the blueprint.  The `group` defines the blueprint nodes that the policy will apply to, and would look something like this:
```yaml
groups:
  group1:
    members: [node1]
    policies:
      my_policy:
        type: my_policy_type
        properties:
          threshold: 5
        triggers:
          workflow_trigger_1:
            type: cloudify.policies.triggers.execute_workflow
            parameters:
              workflow: some_workflow
              workflow_parameters:
                parm1: val1
                parm2: val2
```
Now we have a fully functioning, if useless, policy.  Note that for integration testing, you'll undoubtedly want to leave log (e.g. info stream) statements in your policies.  To see the output on Cloudify manager (as of 3.3.1) tail the file `/var/log/cloudify/riemann/riemann.log`.

## Enhancing the Policy
Triggering a workflow based on a single sample exceeding a threshold is unlikely to be useful in the real world.  More likely, some aggregation over time will be useful.  Riemann supplies number of streams for aggregating collections of events, which get passed en-masse when they reach a threshold.  One useful example is the `moving-time-window`.  `moving-time-window` accumulates events for a number of seconds (the window), and then sends them in a collection to downstream children every time an event arrives.  Downstream children must be streams that handle collections rather than individual events.  First let's modify the event driver to send and event every second:
```ruby
r = Riemann::Client.new
(0..100).each do
  r << {
    host: "www1",
    service: "http req",
    metric: 12.53,
    state: "normal"
  }
  sleep(1)
end
```
Then let's modify the Clojure to add a moving window:
```clojure
(let [index (index)]
  (streams
    (where (service "http req")
      index
      (moving-time-window 10
        #(info "EVENT" %)
        (over 10
          #(info "TRIGGER"  %)
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```
If you run this you will note that "TRIGGER" is never output.  That's because _over_ works on single events and has been handed a collection/seq of events.  Let's average the seq's metric values and send that to `over`.  The "go to" stream in Clojure for combining metrics from seqs of events is _smao_, which applies a regular function (not stream) to a collection of events and passes the result to downstream children.  The Riemann _folds_ namespace has a number of utility functions to process seqs of events.  Spend some time exploring the [code](https://github.com/riemann/riemann/blob/master/src/riemann/folds.clj)  In this case the `mean` function will do nicely.  Recall that in Clojure, explicit namespace references have the syntax `namespace/function`.  So the next version of policy is:

```clojure
(let [index (index)]
  (streams
    (where (service "http req")
      index
      (moving-time-window 10
        #(info "EVENT" %)
        (smap folds/mean
          (over 10
            #(info "TRIGGER"  %)
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
)
```
To make the test a little more interest, we'll modify the test driver to output a metric that increases over time:
```ruby
r = Riemann::Client.new
(0..100).each do |i|
r << {
host: "www1",
service: "http req",
metric: 5+i,
state: "normal"
}
sleep(1)
end
```
Running the test driver then shows something a bit more interesting:
```
INFO [2016-03-03 06:00:50,970] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 15/2, :tags nil, :time 1456984845, :ttl nil}
INFO [2016-03-03 06:00:51,972] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 8, :tags nil, :time 1456984845, :ttl nil}
INFO [2016-03-03 06:00:52,976] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 17/2, :tags nil, :time 1456984845, :ttl nil}
INFO [2016-03-03 06:00:53,977] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 9, :tags nil, :time 1456984845, :ttl nil}
INFO [2016-03-03 06:00:54,977] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 19/2, :tags nil, :time 1456984845, :ttl nil}
INFO [2016-03-03 06:00:55,979] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 21/2, :tags nil, :time 1456984846, :ttl nil}
INFO [2016-03-03 06:00:55,994] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - TRIGGER #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 21/2, :tags nil, :time 1456984846, :ttl nil}
```
Note the metric increasing sequentially until it exceeds the threshold (10), when it prints the "TRIGGER" log statement.  We could go on from here, perhaps parameterizing the window size, adding a cooldown period, and perhaps parameterizing a regular expression for limiting node types.  In any case, the same process applies, making incremental improvements, improving the test driver, and then testing with Cloudify itself.

## The Index
In Riemann, the _index_, is that place that events are stored.  Only the last event for each host/service pair is saved in the index.  Periodically, expired events are removed from the index.  By default, the implementation of the index is a hash map.  As such, it can be used for storing state in the form of events.  Riemann provides the `index/update` function for storing events and `index/lookup` for querying the index by host and service.  Streams are free to store information in the form of events/maps.  The index shouldn't be used as some kind of database for stream state however; see _Creating Your Own Streams_ below for the proper method.  
Since events in the index are expired periodically based on their :ttl field (or _expired_ :state field), it is handy for algorithms that require a timeout.  Consider the threshold policy above, where a "cooldown" period is desired after invoking the `process-policy-triggers` stream.  One solutions is to create a synthetic event, with a :ttl value equal to the cooldown time and write it to the index:
```clojure
(index/update index {:host "phony" :service "cooldown" :ttl 60})
```
Then I'd modify my `process-policy-triggers` call to be inside a condition, something like:
```clojure
(if (nil? (index/lookup index "phony" "cooldown")) (process-policy-triggers))
```
So now, only if my lookup of the "cooldown" event returns nil (meaning it's been expired by the :ttl and removed from the index), only then will I call `process-policy-triggers` again.

## Creating Your Own Streams
Despite the rich API of Riemann, you are likely to need to write your own streams at some point.  As mentioned earlier, streams are high order functions.  Streams _return_ a function that processes events; they don't process events themselves.  Streams can also be composed by containing downstream streams, as we've seen in the Riemann API and the examples above.  To make the most out of writing your own streams, you'll need to get a bit beyond the basics of Clojure, and perhaps read up a bit on the software transactional memory and persistent data structures aspects of the language.  Let's consider the simplest possible stream:
```clojure
(fn [e] (info e))
```
This is the same stream we've been using to log events (`#(info "event" %)`) without the `#` syntax shortcut.  When I need to compose child streams, the definition is still simple but somewhat different:
```clojure
(fn [e & children] (info e) (call-rescue e children))
```
`call-rescue` is a Clojure macro that calls child streams and handles exceptions.  The `& children` syntax in the function parameters declaration is Clojure's version of a variable argument list.  This stream can handle any number of children.  An equally valid stream, that takes boolean predicate for example, might only allow two child streams; one for true and one for false.  

Recall that streams (that are children of the Riemann `streams` stream) are called at startup time in order to configure them and get the function references used for processing actual events.  Besides enabling one-time startup configuration of event processing functions, high order functions also enable the capturing of state.  Consider a stream that sums the metrics flowing through it, passing the sum to child streams.  To do this we'll enclose a Clojure `atom` that refers to the sum:
```clojure
(let [ sum (atom 0) ]
  (fn [ e ]
    (do
      (swap! sum + (:metric e))
      (call-rescue (assoc e :metric @sum) children)
    )
  )
)
```
Since the `let` is external to the internal function, it gets enclosed by the function and can be used to store state.  In this case a reference that points to the sum.  Recall that since Clojure data structures are immutable, you don't have stateful objects or structures. Instead everything is values referenced by symbolic names.  In this case, sum is an `atom` (a kind of simple reference), which the `swap!` function modifies to point at a new sum as the events flow through.  This stream, configured with a child that dumps the resulting event (created by the `assoc` function above), creates output similar to this:
```
INFO [2016-03-03 17:43:49,679] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 5, :tags nil, :time 1457027029, :ttl nil}
INFO [2016-03-03 17:43:50,625] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - #<Atom@4f2453fa: 5>
INFO [2016-03-03 17:43:50,626] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 11, :tags nil, :time 1457027030, :ttl nil}
INFO [2016-03-03 17:43:51,625] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - #<Atom@4f2453fa: 11>
INFO [2016-03-03 17:43:51,626] defaultEventExecutorGroup-2-1 - riemann.config - EVENT #riemann.codec.Event{:host www1, :service http req, :state normal, :description nil, :metric 18, :tags nil, :time 1457027031, :ttl nil}
```
Note that the `metric` value in the events has been replaced by the sum.  A similar approach is used to create the `moving-time-window` stream that we used above from Riemann.  `moving-time-window` closes around a Clojure `vector`, and adds events as they arrive, sending the whole vector downstream to children.  Once you are commited to writing your own streams,   spend some time examining the Riemann [source](https://github.com/riemann/riemann/tree/master/src/riemann) in github, and especially the [streams.clj](https://github.com/riemann/riemann/blob/master/src/riemann/streams.clj) code.

__Important Note For Custom Streams in Policies__: Cloudify doesn't provide a means for defining functions external to the `(streams` element in the configuration.  This means that, unlike the examples you may see on github, as a policy writer your custom streams must be define _in-line_ in the policy.
